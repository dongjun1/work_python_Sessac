    If the argument func have been executed with inputs(*args, **kargs), DO NOT execute the function again;
    rather, load the result from cache of the previous run.

    For each run, print(or write to some file, such as log.txt) the log of the execution, including

    - What function was executed.
    - When does the execution happen.
    - How long does the execution take.
    - What arguments that the execution accepts.

    ex) if the function make_some_noise(decibel: int) was executed with decibel = 10, log should be like below;

    ======================
    2024.10.25 13:46
    function make_some_noise executed with decibel = 10, takes 10.252s.
    ======================
